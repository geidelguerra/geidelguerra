I'm a self taught developer specialized in web and cli tools. Hoping to make some games in the future.

I've been learning to code for myself since I was 16. I started with Macromedia Flash 8 offline help. Then I jumped to C++, C#, Java, Python and eventually landed with PHP and JavaScript. Now mostly working on cli tools using Python and learning C by making games with Raylib.

I prefer working on cli tools and third party integrations on the backend to improve workflows, add new features to existing systems, create new systems. I like the challenge of learning a new language or tooling to solve a problem.

I have some experience with AWS and DevOps. I use Digital Ocean for my personal stuff.

Proficient in English, native Spanish speaker.
