I'm a self taught "Software Developer" specialized in PHP and JavaScript. Hoping to make some games in the future.

I've been learning to code for myself since I was 16. I started with Macromedia Flash 8 offline help. Then I jumped to C++, C#, Java, Python and eventually landed with PHP and JavaScript.

I have experience developing SaaS applications, REST APIs, Third-Party integrations (Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, YouTube, Stripe) and basic websites using NuxtJs and Vue.

I have some experience with AWS and DevOps. I use Digital Ocean for my personal stuff.

I have basic knowledge of Git. I use GitHub for all my personal and company projects.

I've been using Ubuntu Desktop for about 6 years. I use ZSH, Kitty and VSCode.

I know about Jira, Trello, ClickUp and other project management tools. Also know a little about SCRUM methodology and have been using it for a while.

Likes Unit/Feature tests 

Proficient in English, native Spanish speaker.

Currently learning Rust and NeoVim.
